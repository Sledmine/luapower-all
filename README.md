This is a fork from the [luapower all-in-one](https://github.com/luapower/luapower-all) it was made to fit some specific needs for the development of my project [Mercury](https://github.com/Sledmine/Mercury), also to add support for 32 bit builds, it is not intended to be used as an alternative repository for luapower but if it works for you go ahead.
